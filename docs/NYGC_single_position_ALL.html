reproducibility.

The results in this page were generated with repository version
<a href="https://github.com/theandyb/LSCI/tree/9b3e94a04cf96eb941709d7543eb45738722156e" target="_blank">9b3e94a</a>.
See the <em>Past versions</em> tab to see a history of the changes made
to the R Markdown and HTML files.
</p>
<p>
Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for
the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results
(you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or
<code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown
file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it
depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results
were generated:
</p>
<pre><code>
Ignored files:
    Ignored:    .Rhistory
    Ignored:    .Rproj.user/
    Ignored:    analysis/disqus.html
    Ignored:    code/random/
    Ignored:    output/figs/

Untracked files:
    Untracked:  code/output_generation/single_pos_figures.R
    Untracked:  data/example.csv

</code></pre>
<p>
Note that any generated files, e.g. HTML, png, CSS, etc., are not
included in this status report because it is ok for generated content to
have uncommitted changes.

<h1>1000G Single Position Models - All</h1>
<div id="introduction" class="section level2">
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Here in this document we present the results for the single position
models using the singletons from all 2,504 unrelated individuals in the
1000G deep sequence data from the NYGC.</p>
<div id="model-descriptions" class="section level3">
<h3>Model Descriptions</h3>
</div>
<div id="log-linear-model-approach" class="section level3">
<h3>Log Linear Model Approach</h3>
<p>Following the example of Zhu et al (2017), we also construct models
of the form</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\log(n_{ij}) = \lambda_0 + \sum_{k \in \{C,G,T\}} \lambda_j I(i=k) +
\lambda_{s}I(j=s)
\]</span></p>
<p>where we jointly model the counts for singletons and their matched
controls stratified by the nucleotides at a given flanking position in
the +/- 10 bp window. Note that here the model assumes a shared
nucleotide distribution between the singletons and the controls;
allowing for a difference through an interaction term would yield a
fully saturated model. Zhu et al (2017) use the deviance statistic to
identify putative mutation motifs, which compares the above reduced
model to the fully saturated model, with a larger deviance statistic
resulting from a larger difference between the observed distribution of
nucleotides flanking singleton and control sites from the fitted
distribution based on the reduced model. The deviance statistic tends to
increase due to sample size, so Zhu et al (2017) additionally divided
the deviance statistic by twice the sample size to yield the relative
entropy/KL divergence, which is not sensitive to sample size and allowed
for comparisons between mutation sub types. We choose to take a similar
approach in that we compute the KL divergence between the observed and
fitted frequencies for only the singletons.</p>
</div>

<div id="subtype-results" class="section level2">
<h2>9 Subtype Results</h2>
<p>The nine basic subtypes are AT_CG, AT_GC, AT_TA, GC_AT, GC_TA, GC_CG,
cpg_GC_AT, cpg_GC_TA, and cpg_GC_CG, where the notation XY_JK indicates
we either observed a X&gt;J or Y&gt;K substitution, with XY and JK being
complementary to each other. For each sub-type with reference alleles XY
and position i within a 21-mer window centered at the singleton, we
model the distributions of nucleotides A, C, G and T flanking the
singletons using the rates we observe either genome-wide flanking the
reference nucleotides XY at the same relative position or the rates of
nucleotides flanking control positions sampled for each singleton. We
use the chi-square goodness of fit statistic to “measure” the degree to
which this model doesn’t hold. First, let’s plot the deviance statistics
we observe at each relative position for each sub-type.</p>

<p>For this subtype, we observe that the most influential position
appears to be at the -1. We also note that, while in general the
statistic decreases as we move further from the focal position, this
decrease is not monotonic. For example, we see a higher statistic at the
-3 position than we do at the -2, and similarly a higher value is seen
at +2 than is observed at +1.</p>
<p>The statistic at each position can be decomposed into the
contributions from each of the four nucleotides. Here, a positive
residual indicates an enrichment in the singletons relative to the
expectation under the null, while a negative value indicates a
depletion.</p>

<p>Let’s get some information at the +1, where we see the largest
deviance:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>df_resid %&gt;%
  filter(pos == 1) %&gt;%
  select(nuc, status, n) %&gt;%
  pivot_wider(id_cols = nuc, names_from = status, values_from = n) %&gt;%
  mutate(pct_s = singletons / sum(singletons),
         pct_c = controls / sum(controls)) %&gt;%
  mutate(d_s = abs(pct_s - pct_c)) %&gt;%
  pull(d_s) %&gt;%
  mean()</code></pre>
<pre><code>[1] 0.08080729</code></pre>
<p>For this subtype, we see that the signal at the +1 position is driven
by an enrichment of T and a depletion of A. Also notice that at -1, the
primary driver is an enrichment of C; we also observed an enrichment of
C in the A&gt;C subtype.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>df_resid %&gt;% 
  filter(pos == 1) %&gt;% 
  select(nuc, status, n) %&gt;%

  mutate(p_sing = singletons / sum(singletons), 
         p_controls = controls / sum(controls)) %&gt;%
  mutate(l_1 = abs(p_sing - p_controls)) %&gt;%
  mutate(shift_pct = l_1) %&gt;%
  pull(shift_pct) %&gt;%
  mean()</code></pre>
<pre><code>[1] 0.08080729</code></pre>
<p>Let’s also plot the individual position statistics up to +/- 1000bp
from the focal position. Here we’ll color significance based on the null
distribution being a chi-square with df = 3</p>

<p>For this sub type we observe the strongest signal at the +1 relative
position. Below we observe that this signal is driven by an enrichment
of T and depletion of A and G. Also note that we also have an enrichment
of C at the +1, although this is far more mild than observed in the
previous two subtypes.</p>

<p>Here, for this subtype we observe the strongest signals at -1 and +2.

the presentation more consistent at the cost of the webpage sometimes
taking slightly longer to load. Note that this only works because the
